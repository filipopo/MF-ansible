# MF-ansible

This project allows you to automatically provision a Mobile Forces game server together with a responsive website for server management. The website is integrated with Ko-fi and PayPal for donation processing, uses an SQLite3 database to store donation info and displays it on the landing page with more detailed info such as the top donators available on the statistics page

The project is deployed on Hetzner at https://mf.nofisto.com through GitHub Actions and uses Cloudflare as a CDN and domain registrar, the root of the website code can be found at: `templates/webserver/website`

The website was made with `symfony new website --version="7.2.x"`

# Setup instructions

Put your MobileForces.zip in the root folder and run

`ansible-playbook playbook.yml -u root -i mf.nofisto.com,`

You may configure various options in the vars.yml file, by deafult this playbook relies on your MobileForces.zip creating a MobileForces folder

The Ansible playbook transfers game files, installs necessary packages and sets up Systemd services for the game server, master server and FastDL of game files through an Apache2 web server which is also used for the website, an SSL certificate is automatically added to it by using Let's Encrypt's certbot tool, these steps are made in a modular way and can be excluded

It would be good to run `symfony check:requirements` before running the app

```
export APP_SECRET=secret KOFI_TOKEN=token
ADMIN_PASSWORD=P@ssword123! php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
symfony server:start
```

Some other environment variables that can be set (found in .env)

```
APP_ENV=dev
DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///%kernel.project_dir%/var/app.db"
KOFI_NAME={{ AdminName }}
KOFI_TARGET=12.49
KOFI_CURRENCY=â‚¬
KOFI_STARTDATE="2023-10-22 15:35:11"
```

If you can't change the apache vhost run `composer require symfony/apache-pack` which will make a .htaccess file in `public/`

Consider optimising the php config: https://symfony.com/doc/current/performance.html

You can test the donation route after setting KOFI_TOKEN with

`curl -L --data-urlencode data@data.json http://127.0.0.1:8000/donate_notify`

If you change the database files run `php bin/console make:migration`

If you need to change the password, downgrade `php bin/console doctrine:migrations:execute --down DoctrineMigrations\\Version20250107003305` and then migrate again
